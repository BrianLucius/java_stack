<p>This project is an ideation by Brian Lucius and is a capstone project for my <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com/" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a> Java full stack studies.</p>
<p>The project aims to collect and create analytics around the global sentiment of Internet connected beings as often as they can remember to submit their current sentiment to the project.</p>
<p>In addition to recording your current sentiment and your keyword, the project collects several unique identifiers to aid in analytics processing and generation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This experiment will capture the latitude and longitude of your device if you voluntarily enable location services on your device/browser. If location services are not enabled, the latitude and longitude of your ISPs nearest Point of Presence is used instead.</li>
	<li>The IP address assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider is captured.</li>
	<li>A unique browser identifier is collected based on the work of Hone, Inc. and the source can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/honeinc" target="_blank">https://github.com/honeinc/ubid</a>.<br>Much gratitude to the team at Hone, Inc.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the information collected will be sold or distributed to any other entity and is strictly for use in this capstone project by Brian Lucius.</p>
